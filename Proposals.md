# Proposal 1

## Research Question/Hypothesis: 

Is it possible to predict the outcome of Supreme Court Cases (using NLP)?

## Previous Research/Novelty:
Previous papers that we found that focus on legal prediciton use cases form the European Supreme Court

## Papers:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310615519_Predicting_Judicial_Decisions_of_the_European_Court_of_Human_Rights_A_Natural_Language_Processing_Perspective

## Possible Datasets:
Supreme Court Argument Transcripts: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2021 
Case Data and Justice Centered Data https://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php

## Challenges/Risks:
Parsing transcripts from the website might take a while to build a dataset

## Implementation:
Two possible approaches for this taks: 
1) Using oral arguments to predict who the winner is (petitioner/respondent) 
2) Predicting individual Justice behaviour given justice and case dataset type



# Proposal 2

## Research Question/Hypothesis: 
Perhaps investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning between datasets for use as an ML-powered autocomplete feature/recommendation system. Look at the effects of pretraining? Vary the architecture?

## Previous Research/Novelty:
There are loads of papers implementing BERT models( e.g., https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.06690.pdf, https://aclanthology.org/2020.ecnlp-1.8.pdf, etc.), just need to find a novelty aspect to research.

## Possible Datasets:
https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/ - Amazon Product Datasets (e.g., music, movies, etc.)
https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html - Recommender Systems and Personalization Datasets (e.g., recipes)

## Challenges/Risks:
Original research question.

## Implementation:
Implement a transformer based recommender architecture (i.e., BERT model)
