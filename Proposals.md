# Proposal 1

## Research Question/Hypothesis: 

Is it possible to predict the outcome of Supreme Court Cases (using NLP)?

## Previous Research/Novelty:
Previous papers that we found that focus on legal prediciton use cases form the European Supreme Court

## Papers:
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310615519_Predicting_Judicial_Decisions_of_the_European_Court_of_Human_Rights_A_Natural_Language_Processing_Perspective

## Possible Datasets:
Supreme Court Argument Transcripts: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2021 
Case Data and Justice Centered Data https://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php

## Challenges/Risks:
Parsing transcripts formt he website might take awhile to build a dataset

## Implementation:
Two possible approaches for this taks: 
1) Using oral arguments to predict who the winner is (petitioner/respondent) 
2) Predicting individual Justice behaviour given justice and case dataset type
